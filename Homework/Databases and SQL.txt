5 aspects about Databases and SQL
1. Databases let us house and maniupulate data using SQL queries to select
or change aspects of the data.
2. Databases let us describe the data as well as the relationships between tables of the databases
such as a user can have many personal webpages.
3. Databases can use SQL to sort data into different forms ie rearrange data
based on a shared key(column) to perform aggregate functions.
4. Databases and SQL let software and applications reduce/control data redunancy to improve
system performance.
5. Databases allows for data to remain consistent so that various users of a software/application
can concurrently make changes to their data even while others are using it.
